## Your Daily Workflow

As a CS Professional, your dashboard focuses on actionable insights for your assigned client portfolio. Here's how to structure your daily routine with Stanna.

## Morning Client Review (15 minutes)

Start each day by reviewing your dashboard:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check At-Risk Clients">
    Look for clients with health scores below 70 (yellow/red indicators). These need immediate attention.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Due Tasks">
    Check your **Tasks Due** widget for any actions needed today.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Scan Recent Interactions">
    Look through overnight emails, support tickets, or other communications that require follow-up.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Time-saving tip**: Use the "My At-Risk Clients" saved view to quickly focus on accounts needing attention.
</Tip>

## Managing Your Client Portfolio

### Understanding Your Client List

Your client list shows only the accounts assigned to you. Key information at a glance:

- **Health Score**: Color-coded risk indicator
- **Last Interaction**: How recently you've engaged
- **Next Renewal**: Upcoming contract dates
- **MRR**: Revenue value of the account
- **Open Tasks**: Outstanding action items

### Prioritizing Your Work

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="By Health Score">
    Focus on the lowest scores first:
    1. **Red (0-40)**: Crisis management - immediate outreach needed
    2. **Yellow (41-70)**: Schedule check-in calls this week
    3. **Green (71-100)**: Maintain regular cadence, look for expansion
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="By Revenue">
    Protect your highest-value accounts:
    1. Sort clients by MRR (highest first)
    2. Ensure top 20% of revenue gets weekly touchpoints
    3. Document all interactions with high-value stakeholders
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="By Renewal Date">
    Proactive renewal management:
    1. Filter by renewals in next 90 days
    2. Schedule renewal conversations 60 days out
    3. Document expansion opportunities 30 days before renewal
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
