## How Integrations Work

### Data Sync Process
1. **Initial Connection**: Authenticate with your external tool
2. **Permission Setup**: Grant Stanna access to relevant data
3. **Historical Import**: Sync existing data (up to 2 years)
4. **Ongoing Sync**: Automatic updates every 15-30 minutes
5. **Real-time Updates**: Critical events sync immediately

### Data Mapping

Stanna automatically maps common fields but allows customization for unique setups.
