## Support Analytics

### Conversation Metrics

Track key support performance indicators:

- **Resolution Time**: Time from first message to closure
- **Message Volume**: Conversation frequency per client
- **Satisfaction Scores**: Customer ratings and feedback

### Issue Pattern Recognition

Identify trends in support interactions:

### Health Score Impact

Support data influences client health:
- Recent positive resolutions boost health scores
- Escalated issues or complaints lower scores
- Response satisfaction affects relationship strength
- Issue frequency indicates potential problems

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Conversations not importing">
    **Check These Items**:
    - Verify Intercom workspace is active and accessible
    - Confirm OAuth permissions include conversation access
    - Check date range settings for historical import
    - Review conversation filters and inclusion criteria
    
    **Debugging Steps**:
    1. Test connection at `/api/integrations/intercom/status`
    2. Try manual sync with a specific date range
    3. Check Intercom API logs for any errors
    4. Verify conversations exist in specified inboxes
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Client matching issues">
    **Common Problems**:
    - Company domains missing or inconsistent in Intercom
    - Email domain variations (www, subdomains)
    - Multiple companies for single client domain
    - Custom company naming conventions
    
    **Solutions**:
    1. Standardize company domains in Intercom
    2. Update client domains in Stanna to match Intercom
    3. Use manual client matching for edge cases
    4. Review and clean up duplicate company records
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Sentiment scores seem inaccurate">
    **Understanding Limitations**:
    - Support conversations may have different tone than general business communication
    - Customer frustration doesn't always indicate relationship risk
    - Context matters - some "negative" sentiment is resolved quickly
    
    **Improvement Strategies**:
    1. Review conversation resolution outcomes
    2. Use manual attribution to provide context
    3. Weight support sentiment differently than email sentiment
    4. Focus on resolution patterns rather than individual message sentiment
