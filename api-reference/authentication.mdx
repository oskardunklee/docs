## Overview

The Stanna API uses API keys to authenticate requests. API keys can be created and managed through your dashboard settings page.

## Creating an API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Settings">
    Go to your [Stanna Dashboard](https://app.gostanna.com) and click on **Settings** in the navigation
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Find API Keys Section">
    Scroll down to the **API Keys** section at the bottom of the settings page
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create New Key">
    Click the **Create New Key** button and provide a descriptive name for your key
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Copy Your Key">
    Copy the generated API key immediately - it won't be shown again for security reasons
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Your API Key

There are two ways to include your API key in requests:

### Method 1: Authorization Header (Recommended)

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.gostanna.com/api/clients?workspaceId=yourcompany.com" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-your-api-key-here"
```

### Method 2: X-API-Key Header

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.gostanna.com/api/clients?workspaceId=yourcompany.com" \
  -H "X-API-Key: sk-your-api-key-here"
```

## Example: Testing Your API Key

Here's a simple test to verify your API key is working:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.gostanna.com/api/metrics/summary?workspaceId=yourcompany.com" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-your-api-key-here"
```

```javascript Node.js
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

const response = await fetch('https://api.gostanna.com/api/metrics/summary?workspaceId=yourcompany.com', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer sk-your-api-key-here'
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer sk-your-api-key-here'
}

response = requests.get(
    'https://api.gostanna.com/api/metrics/summary',
    params={'workspaceId': 'yourcompany.com'},
    headers=headers
)

data = response.json()
print(data)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
  Never expose your API keys in client-side code, public repositories, or insecure locations.
</Warning>

### Do's
- Store API keys in environment variables
- Use server-side code to make API calls
- Rotate keys regularly
- Create separate keys for different environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Delete unused keys promptly

### Don'ts
- Don't embed keys in client-side JavaScript
- Don't commit keys to version control
- Don't share keys via email or chat
- Don't use the same key across multiple applications

## Managing API Keys

You can manage your API keys through the settings page:

- **View active keys**: See all your active API keys and their last usage
- **Delete keys**: Remove keys that are no longer needed
- **Monitor usage**: Track when each key was last used

## Troubleshooting

### Common Error Messages

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing or invalid API key | Check that your key is correct and properly formatted |
| `403 Forbidden` | Valid key but wrong workspace | Ensure the workspaceId matches your key's workspace |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Rate limit exceeded | Reduce request frequency or implement exponential backoff |

### Testing Authentication

To test if your authentication is working correctly:

```bash
curl -I -X GET "https://api.gostanna.com/api/metrics/summary?workspaceId=yourcompany.com" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-your-api-key-here"
```

A successful response will return `HTTP/2 200`. If you see `401` or `403`, check your API key and workspace ID.
