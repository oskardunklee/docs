## Welcome to the Stanna API

The Stanna API provides programmatic access to your customer health data, metrics, and insights. All endpoints are secured with API key authentication to protect your sensitive customer data.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using API keys. You can create and manage API keys through your Stanna dashboard settings.

### API Key Format

API keys follow the format: `sk-[random string]`

### Authentication Methods

You can authenticate requests using either of these methods:

#### Bearer Token (Recommended)
Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.stanna.com/api/metrics/summary?workspaceId=yourworkspace" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-your-api-key-here"
```

#### X-API-Key Header
Alternatively, you can use the X-API-Key header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.stanna.com/api/metrics/summary?workspaceId=yourworkspace" \
  -H "X-API-Key: sk-your-api-key-here"
```

### Creating API Keys

1. Navigate to **Settings** in your Stanna dashboard
2. Click on **API Keys** tab
3. Click **Create New Key**
4. Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "Production Dashboard", "Mobile App")
5. Copy and securely store your API key - you won't be able to see it again

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code. API keys provide full access to your workspace data.
</Warning>
