# Stanna Security Overview

## Our Commitment to Security

At Stanna, security is not just a feature‚Äîit's a fundamental principle that guides everything we build. We understand that you're trusting us with your customer success data, and we take that responsibility seriously.

## Security Principles

### 1. Security by Design
Every feature is built with security considerations from the ground up, not added as an afterthought.

### 2. Defense in Depth
We employ multiple layers of security controls, ensuring that if one layer is compromised, others remain intact.

### 3. Continuous Improvement
Security is an ongoing process. We regularly update our systems and conduct security assessments.

### 4. Transparency
We're open about our security practices and quickly communicate any issues to our customers.
