# Getting Started with Lars

Welcome to Lars, Stanna's AI-powered assistant! This guide will walk you through your first interaction and help you understand how to leverage AI for more effective customer success management.

## Quick Start

### 1. Find the AI Chat Widget

</Frame>

**Location**: Bottom-right corner of your screen
**Icon**: ü§ñ with "Lars" label
**State**: Minimized by default, click to expand

### 2. Your First Question

Let's start with a simple question to get familiar with the AI:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Chat">
    Click on the AI chat widget to open the conversation interface.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ask About Your Clients">
    Type: "Which clients are at risk of churning?"

    <Note>
    Don't worry about exact wording - the AI understands natural language!
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the Response">
    The AI will analyze your client portfolio and provide:
    - List of at-risk clients with health scores
    - Risk factors for each client
    - Suggested actions to mitigate churn risk
  </Step>

  <Step title="Explore Suggested Actions">
    Look for the "Suggested Actions" section in the response. Each action has:
    - **Title**: What the action will do
    - **Description**: More details about the action
    - **Risk Level**: Safety indicator (Low/Medium/High)
    - **Execute Button**: Click to perform the action
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding AI Responses

### Action Risk Levels

All AI-suggested actions are categorized by risk level:

<Accordion title="üü¢ Low Risk Actions">
  **Automatically executable** - These are safe actions that won't negatively impact client relationships:
  - Generate reports and summaries
  - Create internal tasks and reminders
  - Add tags or notes to client records
  - Update health scores based on data

  **Example**: "Create a follow-up task for next week"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="üü° Medium Risk Actions">
  **Require confirmation** - These actions affect client visibility but are generally safe:
  - Schedule meetings with clients
  - Update client status or tier
  - Send templated check-in emails
  - Modify client lifecycle stage

  **Example**: "Schedule a health check meeting with ClientCorp"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="üî¥ High Risk Actions">
  **Manual review required** - These actions have significant impact and need careful consideration:
  - Send custom emails to clients
  - Update critical client information
  - Modify contract details
  - Escalate to support or leadership

  **Example**: "Send a personalized retention offer email"
</Accordion>

## Common Question Types

### Client Health Analysis

Ask about overall client health and trends:

```
"What's the health status of my enterprise clients?"
"Show me clients with declining sentiment scores"
"Which accounts have the highest engagement this month?"
```

### Risk Assessment

Identify potential churn risks and opportunities:

```
"Identify clients at risk of churning this quarter"
"Show me clients who might be ready for upselling"
"Which clients haven't been contacted recently?"
```

### Action Planning

Get specific recommendations for client management:

```
"What should I do about TechCorp's declining health score?"
"Create tasks for following up with at-risk accounts"
"Generate a report of client health trends"
```

### Data Analysis

Analyze patterns and trends across your portfolio:

```
"What are the main factors affecting client satisfaction?"
"Show me communication patterns with high-value clients"
"Analyze the effectiveness of our outreach campaigns"
```

## Best Practices for AI Interaction

### ‚úÖ Do's

    Include relevant timeframes, client types, or specific concerns: "For our enterprise clients this quarter..."
