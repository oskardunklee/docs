# AI Agent Best Practices

Master advanced strategies to get the most value from your AI assistant and transform your customer success workflow.

## Communication Mastery

### Crafting Effective Queries

The quality of your questions directly impacts the usefulness of AI responses. Here's how to ask better questions:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Specific vs. General">
    **❌ Too General:**
    ```
    "Help me with my clients"
    "What should I do today?"
    "Show me client data"
    ```

    **✅ Specific and Actionable:**
    ```
    "Which enterprise clients have health scores below 70 and no contact in 14 days?"
    "Create follow-up tasks for clients with declining sentiment this month"
    "Generate a churn risk report for Q4 renewals"
    ```

    **Why it works**: Specific queries give the AI clear parameters to work with, resulting in more accurate and actionable responses.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Context-Rich Queries">
    **❌ Missing Context:**
    ```
    "Is TechCorp doing well?"
    "Schedule a meeting"
    "Send an email"
    ```

    **✅ Context-Rich:**
    ```
    "Analyze TechCorp's health trend over the last 3 months and identify any concerning patterns"
    "Schedule a strategic review meeting with TechCorp's stakeholders for next week"
    "Draft a check-in email for TechCorp addressing their recent support ticket volume"
    ```

    **Why it works**: Context helps the AI understand your intent and provide more relevant suggestions.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Multi-Criteria Queries">
    **❌ Single Criterion:**
    ```
    "Show me unhappy clients"
    "Find high-value accounts"
    "List overdue tasks"
    ```

    **✅ Multi-Criteria:**
    ```
    "Find clients with sentiment scores below 60, contract value over $50k, and renewal dates within 90 days"
    "Identify high-value accounts with declining engagement and no recent success manager contact"
    "Show overdue high-priority tasks for at-risk enterprise clients"
    ```

    **Why it works**: Combining multiple criteria helps you find exactly the clients or situations that need attention.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Advanced Query Patterns

Master these query patterns for sophisticated AI assistance:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Comparative Analysis">
    Compare different client segments, time periods, or metrics:

    ```
    "Compare the health scores of enterprise vs. mid-market clients this quarter"
    "How does client engagement differ between Q3 and Q4?"
    "Which client segments have the highest retention rates?"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Predictive Questions">
    Ask the AI to predict outcomes or identify trends:

    ```
    "Which clients are most likely to churn in the next 60 days?"
    "Predict which accounts might be ready for expansion conversations"
    "What patterns indicate a client is becoming more engaged?"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Action-Oriented Requests">
    Get specific, actionable recommendations:

    ```
    "Create a success plan for improving TechCorp's health score"
    "Design an outreach sequence for re-engaging dormant accounts"
    "Generate a list of expansion opportunities with supporting evidence"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Workflow Automation">
    Build complex, multi-step workflows:

    ```
    "For all clients with health scores below 50: create urgent tasks, schedule calls, and draft outreach emails"
    "Set up a weekly process to identify at-risk accounts and notify their CSMs"
    "Create an automated workflow for onboarding new enterprise clients"
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Workflow Optimization

### Daily AI Routines

Establish consistent daily routines that leverage AI for maximum efficiency:

#### Morning Review (5-10 minutes)

    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Priority Identification">
    ```
    "Which 3 clients need my immediate attention today and why?"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Action Planning">
    ```
    "Create a prioritized task list for today based on client risks and opportunities"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### End-of-Day Wrap-up (5 minutes)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Progress Review">
    ```
    "Summarize today's client interactions and their impact on health scores"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Tomorrow's Prep">
    ```
    "What should I prioritize tomorrow? Create tasks for follow-up actions."
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Insights Capture">
    ```
    "Generate insights from today's activities to improve future client management"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Weekly Strategic Reviews

Use AI for deeper strategic analysis and planning:

#### Monday: Week Planning

```
"Analyze my portfolio for this week's priorities. Consider upcoming renewals, at-risk accounts, and expansion opportunities."
```

#### Wednesday: Mid-week Check

```
"Review progress on this week's priorities. Identify any new risks or opportunities that have emerged."
```

#### Friday: Week Wrap & Next Week Prep

```
"Summarize this week's achievements and challenges. What should I focus on next week to improve client outcomes?"
```
