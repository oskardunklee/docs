# Lars Tips & Examples

Learn how to use Lars effectively with these practical examples.

## Common Workflows

### Monday Morning Triage

**Goal**: Get a prioritized list of clients needing attention

**Ask Lars**:
```
"What clients need my attention this week?"
```

Lars will provide:
- Clients with declining health scores
- At-risk clients approaching renewal
- Clients you haven't contacted recently
- Suggested actions for each client

**Follow-up**:
```
"Create tasks for the top 5 priority clients"
```

### Pre-Renewal Check

**Goal**: Review renewals and their health status

**Ask Lars**:
```
"Show me all renewals in the next 30 days and their health scores"
```

Lars will provide:
- List of upcoming renewals
- Current health score for each
- Risk assessment
- Recommended actions

**Follow-up**:
```
"Create check-in tasks for any renewals with health below 60"
```

### Risk Intervention

**Goal**: Identify and address at-risk clients

**Ask Lars**:
```
"Which clients are at high risk of churning this quarter?"
```

Lars will provide:
- List of high-risk clients
- Risk factors for each
- Historical context
- Intervention suggestions

**Follow-up**:
```
"Create urgent follow-up tasks for clients with health below 35"
```

### Portfolio Analysis

**Goal**: Understand overall portfolio health

**Ask Lars**:
```
"Summarize my portfolio health changes this month"
```

Lars will provide:
- Overall health trends
- Clients with significant changes
- Common risk patterns
- Improvement opportunities

## Tips for Better Results

### Be Specific

❌ **Vague**: "Help me with clients"

✅ **Specific**: "Show me enterprise clients with declining sentiment in the last 30 days"

### Include Timeframes

❌ **No timeframe**: "Which clients need attention?"

✅ **With timeframe**: "Which clients need attention this week based on recent activity?"

### Ask Follow-ups

Build on previous responses to get more done:

1. "Which clients are at risk?"
2. "Create tasks for the top 3"
3. "What factors are causing the risk for TechCorp?"

### Use Client Names

When asking about specific clients, use their name:

```
"What's the health status of Acme Corp?"
"Show me recent interactions with TechFlow Inc"
"What should I do about DataCorp's declining sentiment?"
```

## Action Types

### Low Risk Actions
These can be auto-executed:
- Generate reports
- Create tasks
- Add notes
- Update tags

### Medium Risk Actions
These require approval:
- Update health scores
- Schedule meetings
- Modify client status

### High Risk Actions
These require confirmation:
- Send emails
- Modify client data
- Update contract information

## Troubleshooting

### Lars gives generic responses

**Solution**: Add more context to your question
- Include timeframes
- Specify client segments (enterprise, SMB, etc.)
- Mention specific metrics (health score, sentiment, etc.)

### Actions don't execute

**Check**:
- Did you click "Execute"?
- Do you have permission for this action?
- Is the client relationship valid?

### Response doesn't address your question

**Try**:
- Rephrase your question
- Break complex questions into smaller parts
- Ask for clarification on specific points

## Best Practices

1. **Start simple**: Begin with straightforward questions
2. **Be specific**: Include details like timeframes and client types
3. **Review actions**: Always check suggested actions before executing
4. **Use follow-ups**: Build on previous responses
5. **Provide context**: Help Lars understand your specific needs
