## Overview

Stanna's AI-powered health scoring system automatically evaluates the strength of your client relationships on a scale of 0-100. This score is the foundation for identifying at-risk clients, expansion opportunities, and overall portfolio health.

## How Health Scores Work

### Score Range & Meaning
- **ðŸ”´ 0-40**: At Risk - Immediate attention required
- **ðŸŸ¡ 41-70**: Healthy - Monitor regularly  
- **ðŸŸ¢ 71-100**: Thriving - Expansion opportunity

### Default Starting Score
New clients begin with a **neutral score of 50** until sufficient data is collected to calculate an accurate health score.

## Scoring Factors

### Primary Inputs

    **Gmail Integration Data:**
    - Tone analysis of email communications
    - Response time patterns
    - Frequency of positive vs. negative interactions
    - Client engagement with your outreach
    
    **Weight**: High impact on overall score

    - Escalation frequency and severity
    - Customer satisfaction ratings
    - Issue resolution time trends

    - Contract value changes
    - Usage patterns (if available)
    
    **Weight**: High impact for revenue risk
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Temporal Weighting

Recent interactions have more influence than older ones:
- **Last 7 days**: Maximum weight (100%)
- **Last 30 days**: High weight (70%)
- **Last 90 days**: Moderate weight (40%)
- **Older than 90 days**: Low weight (20%)

## Score Attribution

### Understanding Score Changes

Every health score recalculation includes detailed attribution:
- **Reason**: What caused the score to change
- **Delta**: How much the score increased or decreased  
- **Impact Factors**: Which interactions influenced the change
- **Timestamp**: When the change occurred

### Accessing Attribution Data

View score attribution details:
1. **Client Profile**: Click on any client's health score
2. **API Access**: `GET /api/clients/:id/attributions`
3. **Manual Attribution**: `POST /api/clients/:id/attribute` to add context

### Common Score Drivers

**Positive Drivers:**
- Positive email responses and engagement
- Successful issue resolution
- Meeting attendance and participation
- On-time payments and contract renewals

**Negative Drivers:**
- Support escalations or complaints
- Reduced email engagement or ignored messages
- Missed meetings or delayed responses
- Billing issues or payment delays

## Customizing Health Scores

### Risk Thresholds

Adjust what scores trigger alerts:
1. **Default**: Scores â‰¤40 are considered "at risk"
2. **Custom Thresholds**: Set your own risk levels per workspace
3. **Industry Adjustment**: Different thresholds for different client types

### Manual Overrides

When automated scoring doesn't reflect reality:
- **Manual Attribution**: Add context explaining score changes
- **Temporary Adjustments**: Account for known circumstances
- **Permanent Overrides**: For clients with unique situations

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Health score seems too low">
    **Check these factors:**
    - Are all positive interactions being captured by integrations?
    - Is there recent negative interaction data skewing the score?
    - Has the client had recent billing or support issues?
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. Review integration sync status and completeness
    2. Add manual attribution explaining positive context
    3. Check for recent negative interactions that need context
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Health score not updating">
    **Common causes:**
    - Integration sync issues preventing new data
    - Insufficient interaction data for recalculation
    - Client domain mismatch between systems
    
    **Troubleshooting:**
    1. Check integration status at `/api/integrations/status`
    2. Verify recent interactions exist in source systems
    3. Trigger manual sync if needed
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Score changes seem random">
    **Understanding score volatility:**
    - New clients may have unstable scores until sufficient data is collected
    - Infrequent interactions can cause larger score swings
    - Integration backfill may temporarily affect historical scoring
    
    **Stabilization strategies:**
    1. Allow 30-60 days for new clients to develop stable scores
    2. Focus on trends rather than individual score values
    3. Use manual attribution to provide stability context
