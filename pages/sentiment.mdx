Stanna computes a sentiment value **âˆ’2..2** per interaction using a curated lexicon on **subject** and a short **content snippet**. Direction matters:
- inbound negative weighs more than outbound negative
- recent messages weigh more than older ones

You can override sentiment on any interaction from the UI.
