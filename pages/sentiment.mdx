## How Sentiment Analysis Works

### Sentiment Scale

Stanna computes sentiment values on a **-2 to +2** scale:
- **+2**: Highly positive (enthusiastic, appreciative)
- **+1**: Positive (satisfied, collaborative)  
- **0**: Neutral (informational, transactional)
- **-1**: Negative (frustrated, concerned)
- **-2**: Highly negative (angry, threatening to churn)

## Sentiment Weighting & Impact

### Directional Weighting

Communication direction affects sentiment impact:
- **Inbound negative**: Higher weight (client expressing dissatisfaction)
- **Outbound negative**: Lower weight (you addressing issues)
- **Inbound positive**: High weight (client expressing satisfaction)
- **Outbound positive**: Moderate weight (your positive communications)

### Temporal Weighting

Recent sentiment carries more weight than historical sentiment:
- **Last 7 days**: 100% weight
- **8-30 days**: 70% weight  
- **31-90 days**: 40% weight
- **Over 90 days**: 20% weight

This ensures current relationship status is prioritized over past issues that may have been resolved.

## Sarcasm Detection

### How Sarcasm Detection Works

Stanna uses advanced AI models to detect sarcasm and irony in client communications, ensuring that seemingly positive messages with sarcastic intent are correctly identified as negative sentiment.

**Detection Methods:**
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses fine-tuned BERT models specifically trained on sarcasm detection with 92%+ accuracy
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies common sarcastic phrases and structures
- **Context Clues**: Analyzes punctuation patterns, contradictory statements, and exaggerated language

**Common Sarcasm Patterns Detected:**
- Exaggerated positive phrases: "Oh great!", "Just wonderful", "Exactly what I needed"
- Quotation marks around positive words: "This is 'great'"
- Contradictory statements: "This is perfect... but it doesn't work"
- Excessive punctuation: Multiple exclamation marks or mixed punctuation
- Common sarcastic expressions: "Thanks a bunch", "Brilliant", "Couldn't be better"

**Sentiment Adjustment:**
When sarcasm is detected with high confidence (>70%), the apparent sentiment is flipped:
- Apparent positive becomes negative
- The adjusted sentiment reflects the true negative intent
- Confidence levels are maintained for transparency

<Info>
Sarcasm detection helps prevent misclassification of frustrated clients whose negative feelings are expressed through ironic positive language.

## Content Analysis Details

### Subject Line Analysis

Email subject lines provide immediate sentiment indicators:
- **Urgent/Escalation**: "URGENT", "Problem", "Issue", "Help needed"
- **Positive**: "Thank you", "Great meeting", "Success", "Appreciation"
- **Neutral**: "Meeting notes", "Follow-up", "Update", "Question"
- **Negative**: "Disappointed", "Concerned", "Problem", "Not working"

### Content Snippet Processing

Stanna analyzes key portions of message content:
- **Opening and closing phrases**: Tone-setting language
- **Key sentence sentiment**: Main message emotional content
- **Context clues**: References to satisfaction, issues, or future plans
- **Professional formality**: Changes in communication style

## Sentiment Attribution

### Understanding Sentiment Changes

Track what drives sentiment variations:
- **Specific interactions**: Which emails or conversations affected scores
- **Content triggers**: Particular words or phrases that influenced analysis
- **Trend patterns**: How sentiment is changing over time
- **Contextual factors**: Business events that correlate with sentiment changes

### Manual Sentiment Overrides

When automated analysis misinterprets context:
1. **Access client interaction history**
2. **Identify incorrectly analyzed interactions**  
3. **Use manual attribution** to provide correct context
4. **Document reasoning** for future reference

<Info>
Manual overrides help train the AI system to better understand your specific business context and communication patterns.

## Integration-Specific Considerations

### Gmail Sentiment Patterns

**Professional Email Norms:**
- Formal business communication tends toward neutral baseline
- Urgency doesn't always indicate negative relationship health
- Thank you messages and positive feedback carry high positive weight
- Issue reporting is expected and manageable if followed by resolution

### Intercom Support Context

**Support Communication Expectations:**
- Customers contacting support often start with neutral or slightly negative sentiment
- Resolution quality significantly impacts final sentiment score
- Multiple tickets about the same issue indicate deeper problems
- Quick, effective resolution often results in positive sentiment

### HubSpot Business Intelligence

**Deal and Meeting Context:**
- Meeting attendance and engagement indicate relationship investment
- Deal progression stagnation may reflect underlying concerns
- Contract negotiations can temporarily affect sentiment
- Long sales cycles require different sentiment interpretation

## Troubleshooting Sentiment Analysis

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sentiment seems inaccurate">
    **Common causes:**
    - Cultural or industry-specific communication styles
    - Complex sarcasm patterns not detected by AI models
    - Technical language interpreted as negative
    - Context missing from snippet analysis
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. Use manual attribution to provide correct context
    2. Review complete interaction context, not just snippets
    3. Consider industry-specific communication norms
    4. Document patterns for future reference
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Sentiment not updating">
    **Check these factors:**
    - Are integrations syncing properly?
    - Is there sufficient interaction data for analysis?
    - Are interactions being correctly attributed to clients?
    
    **Troubleshooting:**
    1. Verify integration sync status
    2. Check for recent interactions in source systems
    3. Confirm client domain matching is working correctly
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Sentiment too volatile">
    **Understanding volatility:**
    - Small interaction volumes can cause large sentiment swings
    - New clients may have unstable sentiment until more data is collected
    - Single negative interactions can disproportionately affect overall sentiment
    
    **Stabilization strategies:**
    1. Focus on sentiment trends rather than individual values
    2. Allow time for sentiment patterns to establish (30-60 days)
    3. Use manual attribution to provide stabilizing context
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Privacy & Data Handling

### Sentiment Data Security

- **Content analysis**: Only analyzes content for sentiment, doesn't store complete message text
- **Encryption**: All sentiment data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access control**: Sentiment details only available to authorized team members
- **Data retention**: Sentiment scores retained according to workspace policies

### Compliance Considerations

- **GDPR compliance**: Sentiment analysis respects data processing preferences
- **Opt-out options**: Clients can request exclusion from automated sentiment analysis
- **Data minimization**: Only processes content necessary for sentiment evaluation
- **Transparency**: Clear documentation of how sentiment analysis affects client relationships

<Warning>
**Cultural Sensitivity**: Sentiment analysis may interpret communication styles differently across cultures. Consider manual overrides for international clients with different communication norms.
</Warning>

<Info>
**Sentiment Training**: The AI system continuously learns from manual overrides and feedback. Regular use of manual attribution helps improve accuracy for your specific business context.
