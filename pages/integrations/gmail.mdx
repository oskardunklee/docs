Gmail provides the primary interaction feed.

**What we fetch**
- Message metadata and short snippet
- Thread participants and timestamps

**What we never fetch**
- Attachments and full bodies by default

**Quotas**
Respect Gmail daily and per-user quotas. If you hit `403: rateLimitExceeded`, see **Troubleshooting â†’ Gmail quota**.
