### Key Performance Cards

Four primary KPI cards give you instant visibility into portfolio health:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Average Health Score" icon="heart-pulse">
    Portfolio-wide health score (0-100) with trend indicators showing week-over-week changes
  </Card>

  <Card title="MRR at Risk" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Total revenue from at-risk clients (health ≤40) requiring immediate attention
  </Card>

  <Card title="Upcoming Renewals" icon="calendar-check">
    Number and total value of contract renewals in the next 30 days
  </Card>

  <Card title="Integration Health" icon="link">

Each card includes:
- **Visual indicators**: Color-coded status (green for healthy, red for at-risk)

### At-Risk Clients Table

The prominent **Clients Requiring Attention** table surfaces your most critical accounts:

The table automatically prioritizes clients by:
1. Health score (lowest first)
