## Overview

Client management is the heart of Stanna. Every client in your portfolio gets a detailed profile that tracks interactions, sentiment, revenue, and relationship health automatically.

## Client Portfolio Overview

Your main client list provides a comprehensive, sortable view of your entire portfolio. Instantly see health scores, sentiment indicators, MRR, last contact dates, and CSM assignmentsâ€”all with smart filtering and visual status indicators.

### Portfolio Statistics

The header displays key metrics:
- **Total active clients** (excluding hidden clients)
- **At-risk clients** (health score â‰¤ 40 by default)
- **Stale contacts** (no interaction in 14+ days by default)
- **Excluded clients** (hidden from main metrics)

### Smart Filtering

Filter clients by category:
- **Active Clients**: All non-excluded clients (default view)
- **At Risk**: Clients with health scores below your risk threshold
- **Stale**: Clients with no recent contact (configurable days)
- **Excluded**: Clients hidden from main portfolio metrics

## Individual Client Profiles

Each client gets a dedicated profile page with detailed health tracking, interaction timeline, and stakeholder management.

Detailed interaction tracking from integrated platforms:

### Manual Score Attribution
Provide context for health score changes:
